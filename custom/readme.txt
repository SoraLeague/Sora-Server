To-do list:
1) Finish Badge commands (I'll wait for blade)
2) Add tournament bucks
3) Add tournament elo/tournament ranks
4) Profiles
5) Games
6) Spamroom (Currently working on this one ~ Silver)
I'm pretty sure there are more tiny things, but these are all the major things I can think of at the moment.
If anyone's done fixing anything, edit this file so that we get to know, kay~?
